            question: "How does the ticket purchasing process for Tomorrowland work through our service?",
            answer: "The process works as follows: the client selects the Tomorrowland event they wish to attend (Belgium, Brazil, Winter) by completing a form with their personal details, phone number, and email address. We register this information, and on the ticket sale day, we use our application to enter the purchase queue with thousands of accounts previously registered on Tomorrowland. Once we bypass the queue, we send a link to the client via email and WhatsApp to complete the purchase. After the purchase, the ticket is linked to a Tomorrowland account under our control. To release this account and allow the client to personalize the tickets in their name, an additional payment of 100 euros is required through a secure PayPal payment link that we will provide.",
        },
        {
            question: "For which Tomorrowland festivals can our service be hired?",

        },
        {
            question: "How will I be notified once I get through the Tomorrowland ticket purchase queue?",
            answer: "Once the Tomorrowland ticket purchase queue is completed, a notification will be sent to the email registered on gettomorrowlandtickets.com and WhatsApp. This notification will include the link for the client to proceed with the ticket purchase, and they will have 10 minutes to complete the purchase after receiving the notification.",
        },
        {
            question: "What happens once I purchase the ticket using the link provided by our service?",
            answer: "After the purchase is completed, the ticket will be linked to a Tomorrowland account under our control. To personalize the ticket and register it under the client's name, an additional payment of 100 euros must be made through a secure PayPal payment link, which will be sent to the client's email and WhatsApp.",
        },
        {
            question: "Why do I need to pay an additional 100 euros after purchasing the ticket?",

        },
        {
            question: "What happens if I don’t pay the 100 euros for our service?",

        {
            question: "In what order are the ticket purchase links for Tomorrowland festivals sent to the client through our service?",
            answer: "The order in which the Tomorrowland ticket purchase links are sent follows a FIFO (First In, First Out) system. This means that clients who registered on gettomorrowlandtickets.com earlier will receive their purchase link before those who registered later, unless they have used the Bid Now functionality.",
        },
        {
            question: "What is the purpose of the Bid Now option on gettomorrowlandtickets.com?",
            answer: "The Bid Now option on gettomorrowlandtickets.com allows clients to prioritize their ticket purchase link ahead of others in the queue. By using this feature, clients can get through the standard FIFO (First In, First Out) system and receive their purchase link earlier, increasing their chances of securing tickets for Tomorrowland festivals. The higher the amount paid, the higher the priority in the queue, ensuring faster access to the purchase link.",

        {
            question: "What do I need to keep in mind on the ticket sale day?",

        },
        {
            question: "How will I receive the Tomorrowland bracelet?",
            answer: "Once the payment for our service has been made and the ticket personalized, Tomorrowland will send the bracelet directly to the address registered on the Paylogic platform at the time the ticket purchase was completed. Alternatively, you can collect the bracelet directly at the festival with the e-ticket provided by Paylogic.",
